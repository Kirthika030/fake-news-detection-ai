# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection System using NLP and Deep Learning

This project is a fake news detection system developed as part of a college summer internship by a team of three members. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to classify news articles as real or fake.

We used the Fake and Real News Dataset from Kaggle and implemented the solution in Python using libraries such as NLTK, TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit.

The system includes:
- A cleaned and preprocessed news dataset
- A trained LSTM model for text classification
- A Streamlit-based web application for real-time prediction with confidence scores

The project demonstrates how deep learning and NLP can be effectively combined to build a reliable and user-friendly fake news detection tool.
